Develop the Feature:

	Create a new file called project_overview.md.

	Write a summary of the project's purpose and goals.

	Make two separate, small commits on this branch. For example:

	git commit -m "docs: Add project overview section"

	git commit -m "fix: Correct grammar in project overview"

	Merge into main:

	Switch back to the main branch: git checkout main

	Integrate your feature branch using git merge: git merge feature/add-project-overview

	Push the updated main branch to the remote: git push origin main

Gitflow Branching Strategy
